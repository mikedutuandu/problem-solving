1. Implement the a sample app as requirement below:

    A. Design and implement smart contracts for gaming achievements and NFT functionality and Deployment solidity 2 way
        + By hardhat-ethers hardhat plugin ( for test )
        + By Hardhat ignition( for prod )
        + upgrade by uups

    B. Implement BE code base with sample app cover require below

        Build and maintain backend services using TypeScript and Feathers.js

        Handle file uploads and media processing for user-generated content
              + AWS S3 or similar cloud storage solutions
              + Knowledge of IPFS and decentralized storage solutions

        Optimize database queries and manage data across MongoDB and Redis
              + mongodb and Redis as hook cache on GET api to improve performance

        Implement blockchain event listeners and webhooks

        Real-time applications and WebSocket

        Build scalable APIs that interact with multiple blockchain networks

        Integrate Web3 wallets and handle blockchain transactions (Privy integration experience is a plus)

        Work with ENS domains and blockchain name services

        Implement token-gating and blockchain-based authentication systems
            + Token-gating is an access control mechanism that requires users
              to own specific blockchain tokens (like NFTs or cryptocurrencies)
              to access certain content, features, or services.

        Understanding of blockchain scaling solutions and gas optimization

    C. Implement FE sample app interact with BE above
        - Web3.js/Ethers.js
        - Feather client(http/websocket)
        - NextJS
        - Tailwind
