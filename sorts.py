# 1. Bubble Sort============================
# Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

        #  in place
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):

            # traverse the array from 0 to
            # n-i-1. Swap if the element

            # next element
